        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Er. Perumal Manimekalai College of Engineering, Hosur, with a deep passion for Full Stack Development and Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p>My journey in technology started with a curiosity to understand how software is built and how complex problems can be solved with code. Over time, I have developed strong skills in front-end and back-end development, working with technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and databases like MySQL and MongoDB.</p>

<p>One of my notable achievements is the creation of an AI Transformer-based Text Generation Project, where I implemented encoder-decoder architectures, input embedding, positional encoding, and attention mechanisms to build a model capable of generating coherent and context-aware text. This project enhanced my understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP), deep learning models, and the practical application of AI in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I am constantly exploring new tools, frameworks, and emerging trends in technology. I enjoy working on end-to-end solutions, from designing intuitive user interfaces to optimizing backend performance and integrating intelligent features using AI.</p> 

<p> I believe in continuous learning, problem-solving, and innovation, and my goal is to contribute to impactful projects that combine software engineering excellence with AI-powered solutions.</p>
